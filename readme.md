# Discovering PDEs from Multiple Experiments

#### In this repo, we share the code, data and results of the paper
#### 
#### 
#### (1) To promote grouped sparsity:
#### we propose and implement a randomized adaptive group Lasso with stability selection and error control
#### 
#### 
#### (2) Deep learning based model discovery
#### we implement it in DeepMod that we extend to handle multiple experiments
####
#### (3) We share the code to reproduce cases: varying parameters, varying initial conditions and different chaotic regimes
###

### Requirements: conda and pip requirements are shared (see .txt files)
